# About me

My name is Salvatore Dâ€™Angelo and I am a professional software programmer since 1999.

I started programming in 1986 as a hobby and before the transition to the professional job I worked with several programming languages like Turbo Pascal, C, C++, Java, SQL, and Visual Basic.

I always believed that the best way to learn a programming language or technology is to create a small project with it. For this reason, in that period I worked on different projects like compilers, operating systems, shop management, and so on. You can find some of them on my [Github page](https://github.com/sasadangelo/).

At that time I attended the Computer Science school in a small neighboring town. In 1992 I started attending Computer Science at Salerno University and I graduated with honors in 1998.

After a brief period of military service, I started working in 1999. For a couple of months, I worked for a small company in Naples and then I moved to a well-known American software company in Rome where I still work.

In this company, I worked on many projects collaborating in the design and implementation of many software products. Currently, I work in the Cloud area designing and implementing resilient solutions for our platform. You can read my full career history on my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvatore-d-angelo-0321851/).

If this is the first time you land on this website I suggest you read the [Start Here page]({{ site.baseurl }}/start-here/) that explains why I created it and how it can help you to become a better programmer.
