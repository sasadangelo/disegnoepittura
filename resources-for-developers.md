## Resources for Game Programming

Software programming includes a wide range of topics that it is impossible to cover even in 30 years of experience. However, I consider game programming the funniest topic that a software developer can work on. Moreover, it is also a challenging task because games are very different from normal applications. They require dedicated skills that cover a wide range of topics like animation, programming, graphics, AI, physics, performance, and much more.

In this section, I will collect the most important web resources for game programming.
