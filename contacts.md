# Contacts

If you wish to contact me, write your message using the following contact form. Remember to enter the required fields: **Your Name**, **Your Email**; and the **Subject** that will help me understand the topic of the message immediately.

Consider that I generally read all the messages that come from this form. If possible, I try to answer within 24 hours. It could happen, however, that for personal problems, for commitments or for other reasons, my answer may arrive a little late. In such cases, I only ask for a little patience because, within the limits of my possibilities, I always try to respond to everyone.

If you wish you can also contact me on the [Linkedin social network](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvatore-d-angelo-0321851/).
